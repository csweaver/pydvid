Optional GUI
============

There is a simplistic GUI for browsing the contents of a DVID server implemented in ``pydvid/gui/contents_browser.py``.
It requires `PyQt4`_ as a dependency.  You can launch it like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pydvid.gui.contents_browser

.. _PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
